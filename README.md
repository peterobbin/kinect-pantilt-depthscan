The goal of this project is to make a pan tilt controllable Kinect installation that fits the need of my thesis.

## Progress
- Now getting delayed frames from Kinect. 
- 3D slit scan implemented 
- Added control for Kinect to tilt
- Inpainting method applied to smooth Kinect depth image

## TODO
- Connected to Arduino controlled pan tilt mount for Kinect.
- Performance
- Improve Inpainting Algorithm to reduce artifacts
